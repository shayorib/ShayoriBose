# Shayori Bose

As a high school junior passionate about scientific innovation, I aspire to become an oncologist advancing cancer care through AI-driven research, wet-lab experimentation, and clinical translation. I aim to bridge computational discovery and hands-on science to develop data-informed, clinically relevant solutions that transform oncology and improve patient outcomes.

## Highlights of my life

{% capture text %}

I am studying gene regulatory networks in pancreatic cancer at the Biocomputing Lab, Marquette University. In this project, I analyze large-scale genomics datasets using R and Bioconductor to find important molecular interactions that may drive cancer growth. This work has helped me build strong skills in bioinformatics and data analysis, and improved my understanding of how computational tools can be used to study complex biological systems. My goal is to use these approaches to identify biomarkers and treatment targets that can support more personalized and effective cancer therapies.

Beyond academics, I actively engage in music, art, and Taekwondo, and dedicate time to volunteering, mentoring, and fundraising, which have strengthened my creativity, discipline, and commitment to making a positive impact in my community.
